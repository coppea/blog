I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow.

狗狗在上面睡觉的
The dog sleeps on it.

我没亲枕头 妈
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom.

我就是昨晚没睡好
I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

你是凯撒大帝
You're a real julius caesar.

但是我觉得学校这种东西
But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, jerry.

纯属浪费时间 一堆人乱跑乱撞
It's a waste of time. A bunch of people running around, bumping into each other.

前面的人说"二加二"
G-guy up front says, "Two plus two."

后面的人说"四"
The people in the back say, "Four."

下课铃一响 他们给你一盒牛奶
Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a

一张纸 上面写着
Piece of paper that says you can

你可以去上个大号
Go take a dump or something.

学校不适合聪明人待
I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry.

我知道不是什么主流观点 但我就这么想的
And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.

早餐很棒 Beth
This was a good breakfast, Beth.

你真是煎得一手好蛋
You really made the crap out of those eggs.

要是你妈妈也能吃到就好了

噢 爸爸
Oh, dad.

What?

没搞错吧
For real?

都坐好
All right, now, everybody get settled.

Get away from the windows!

今天我们要来点真家伙
Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today.

你们可能听说过
You might have heard of it.

乖乖写
Tough!

第一排拿一张
First row, take one.

剩下的往后传
Pass it back for me.

这里竞争是很激烈的
The stakes are high in this room.

每天都有生死攸关的事发生
There's crucial things happening here every day.

有人越来越聪明
People getting smarter.

有人越来越蠢
Some of y'all getting dumber.

有的人根本看不到三点的太阳
Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00.

嗨 Morty
Hi, Morty.

哇哦
Whoa!

嗨 Jessica

想看看吗
Can I show these to you?

谢谢
Thank you.

你知道我管它们叫啥吗
You know what I named these?

我的小Motry
My little morties.

知道我想让你干嘛吗
Do you know what I want you to do with them?

重新取个名字
Rename them?

Squeeze them.

使劲揉
Manhandle them.

大力不要停
Give them the business.

Frank 早上好
Uh, morning, Frank.

"早上好" 你什么意思
"Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean?

你在取笑我吗
You making fun of me?

你这是在暗示我家里穷吗
Are you trying to say my family's poor?

Frank  没必要动刀子吧
Oh, geez, frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary.

不用刀子也能搞定啊
I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.

轮得到你来教我吗
You telling me how to bully now?

这你就错了 Morty
Big mistake, Morty.

现在我要砍了你 因为我家有钱
And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich.

你在这儿啊 Morty

我不知道 Rick
I don't know, rick.

我不能再逃学了
I-I can't leave school again.

你知道去那边有多危险吗
Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty?

你觉得我一个人能行吗
What do you think? I can just do it all by myself?

快来
Come on!

好吧
Aw, geez. Okay.

我或许可以翘一节历史
I guess I can skip history.

Frank咋办
What about Frank?

你是不是该给他解冻

等会儿再说
I'll do it later, Morty.

他没事的
He'll be fine.

我们走
Let's go.

天 我要遇上Frank Palicky了
Oh, my god. I'm about to walk past frank Palicky.

这就是以后讲给我们孩子听的邂逅啊
This is the story we'll be telling our children.

嗨Frank
Hi, Frank.

咚咚咚
Knock, knock.

Jerry
Jerry?

经理给了一小时的午餐时间
My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought,

我就想"干嘛不来我老婆上班的地方看看呢"
"Hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"

它快不行了
We're losing him.

好了 稳住了
Okay, he's back.

Jerry 请务必告诉我你有非来不可的理由
Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.

午餐啊

把你爸送进养老院吧
Let's put your dad in a nursing home.

这哔哔叫我听得见
We can hear the beeps!

好了 来吧 Morty 我们走
There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.

好吧
Oh, geez. Okay.

天啊 Rick
Oh, man, Rick.

这是个啥地方
What is this place?

这是35c次元 这儿的气候非常适合一种特殊的树
It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of

叫做奇异树
Tree, morty, called a mega tree,

树上有果子 果子里有种子
And there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits.

那就是奇异种
I'm talking about mega seeds.

这种种子非常强大 我的研究需要这些种子
They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.

Rick 我看了下四周
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place,

总觉得有点怕怕的呢
And I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.

好吧好吧
All right. All right.

冷静点 听我说 Morty
Calm down. Listen to me, morty.

我知道人在新环境里会感到不安
I know that new situations can be intimidating.

你看周围 又吓人又陌生
You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but,

迎头而上 像一头公牛一样冲过去
You know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull

这样人才能成长
that's how we grow as people.

我经常遇到可怕的事
I'm no stranger to scary situations.

我一直在和它们打交道
I deal with them all the time.

你跟着我
Now, if you just stick with me, Morty,

我们一定会 妈呀 快跑 Morty
we're gonna be... Holy crap, Morty, run!

我这辈子都没见过这玩意儿
I never seen that thing before in my life.

这到底是啥鬼东西啊
I don't even know what the hell it is!

快跑啊Morty
We got to get out of here, morty!

它会杀了我们的
It's gonna kill us!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die!

我们要挂了
We're gonna die, morty!

Morty 深呼吸
Oh, Morty, take a deep breath.

呼吸点新鲜空气
Breathe that, breathe that fresh air in, morty.

闻到没
Y-you smell that?

充满了冒险气息啊 Morty
That's the smell of adventure, Morty.

一条完全不同的进化之路的味道
That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline.

好了Rick
All right, Rick,

还要多久啊
Look how much longer is this gonna be?

我是不是该回学校了
Shouldn't I be back at school by now?

开什么玩笑
Are you joking me?

看看你周围这些鬼玩意儿
I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us.

看那边那个
Look at that thing right there.

这是什么鬼
W-what the hell is that thing?

你觉得你在学校能看见
You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?

看它滚来滚去
Look at it just lumbering around.

无法用逻辑理解
It defies all logic that thing.

Rick 我明白
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

我们周围全是怪物
We're surrounded by monsters.

所以我才想走啊
That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.

看见了吗 Morty
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?

看见下面是什么了吗
You see what we just stumbled upon, morty?

知道是啥吗
Any idea what that is down there?

奇异树吗
The mega trees?

没错Morty
That's right, Morty

长着果子的奇异树
The mega trees with the mega fruit on them.

我要的就是这个呀 Morty 种子就在那儿
And that's what I'm talking about, morty. That's where my seeds are.

如果我们按你说的来 那就永远找不到了
If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have

因为你如此迷恋你的学校
Found them, because y because you're so in love with school.

好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

这些种子到底有什么特别的
So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?

Morty 别问这么多问题
You ask a lot of questions, Morty.

这样不好
Not very charismatic.

很碍事的
It makes you kind of an under underfoot figure.

穿上这鞋子 Morty
Just take these shoes, Morty.

这是特制的吸附鞋
They're sp special grappling shoes.

只要穿着这宝贝儿
When you're wearing these things ba these babies,

你想往哪儿走往哪儿走
You can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty

往上 往下 倒立 转到左边
Up, down, below, turn around to the left.

怎么都行
These things really bring it all together.

啊
Aah!

Morty 你得先启动它们
You have to turn them on, Morty!

先把鞋子的开关打开
The shoes have to be turned on!

我绝不会送我爸去养老院
I am not putting my father in a home!

他才刚回到我的生活中
He just came back into my life,

你就想这么把他塞床垫下面
And you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress

跟上月的维多利亚的秘密产品目录为伍吗
like last month's victoria's secret?

我说了我是在给你订情人节礼物嘛
I told you I was ordering you something for valentine's day.

而且你爸对我们的孩子有很不好的影响
More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.

你们没问题吧 Beth
Everything cool in here, Beth?

没事的 Davin
It's fine, Davin.

那就好
Okay, cool.

我们今天一起完成了一件伟大的事
You know, we did something great today.

没什么比马儿的心脏更高贵自由了
There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse.

既然我们在吵架
Since we're fighting,

如果你跟那家伙有过什么
If you ever have an affair with that guy,

我就去酒店房间吞子弹
I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out

把脑浆全崩到你的裸体上
all over your naked bodies.

我理解你承受的压力
Look, I appreciate the stress you're under,

但是Morty早在我爸搬进来前
but morty was having trouble in school way

学习就有问题了
Before my dad moved in,

我唯一能看到Rick带来的影响就是 这么久以来
and the only influence I can see rick having is that, for the first time in his life,

Morty第一次有了朋友
Morty has a friend.

或许你是对的
Well, maybe you're right.

或许是吧
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

我是我爸的女儿
I'm my father's daughter.

我很聪明
I'm smart.

不然咋当上心外科医生的
Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?

马心外科医生
Horse heart surgeon.

你好
Hello?

Smith太太吗
Mrs. Smith?

我是阴道校长 别做联想
This is principal Vagina no relation.

请问你和Morty的父亲今天下午能
I wonder if you and morty's father might be able to have a

过来谈谈吗
Chat with me this afternoon?

Morty你把你的腿弄得真惨
Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now.

你得把开关打开 这鞋子才能用啊
You know, you got to turn the shoes on, morty, for them to work.

看我的打开了
Yeah, look I turned mine on.

我下来的多顺当
I had no problem getting down here.

简直是轻松愉快
It was a leisurely breeze.

我快疼死了 Rick
I'm in a lot of pain, rick.

嗯 我看得出来
Yeah, I can see that.

不过你应该还能帮我把种子采来的吧
But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, morty?

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?!

够了 Rick
That's it, Rick!

我忍不了了
That's the last straw!

简直不敢相信
I can't believe this

我两条腿都断了
I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken,

你还要我去帮你弄种子
and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?!

嗷嗷嗷
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

你是个怪物
Y-y-you're a monster.

跟希特勒似的 至少希特勒心里还装着德国
Y-you're like hitler, but but even hitler cared about Germany or something.

好吧 等我一下 Morty
Okay, hold on just a second, morty.

哇哦Rick 这个一下就治好了我的腿
Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly.

这辈子没觉得这么好过
I mean, I've never felt so good in my life.

谢谢
Thank you.

别管了 Morty
Don't worry about it, Morty.

快过来帮我弄种子
Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?

没问题 Rick
Sure thing, Rick.

虽然你没问
Not that you asked,

不过刚才我去了一个未来的次元
Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future

医学高度发达
Dimension with such advanced medicine

治断腿的血清到处的药店都有卖的
that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.

这种东西满街都是
The stuff was all over the place, morty.

听上去好厉害啊 Rick
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

就是有个小问题
There's just one problem, Morty, one little hang-up.

我去的次元太发达了
The dimension I visited was so advanced,

他们抑制了衰老
they had also halted the aging process,

那儿的每个人都很年轻 也从未老过
and everyone there was young, morty, and they had been forever.

我是那儿唯一的老人
I was the only old person there, morty.

在那儿 我就像一个名人般
It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around.

他们觉得我可迷人了
I-I was fascinating to them.

那边有很多美女
There were a lot of attractive Women there, morty,

她们都想和我共度良宵
and they they they they all wanted time with me.

我和很多美女玩得非常开心
I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies,

但我在那边待太久了 次元传送装置它
but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device

没有能量了
it's got no charge left, Morty.

没有能量了
It's got no charge left.

啥
What?!

它现在就是一废物
It's as good as garbage, morty.

已经没用了
It's not gonna work anymore, morty.

Rick 这可不妙
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good.

那我们怎么办
W-what are we gonna do?

我现在得回学校了
I-I have to be back at school right now.

我们要怎么回家
How are we gonna get back home?

有很多办法可以回家
There's ways to get back home, Morty.

只是麻烦点而已
It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle.

我们得去过空间海关
We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs,

所以我还得要你帮个忙
so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.

啊哦
Uh-oh.

我们到海关的时候
When we get to customs,

你得把这些种子
I'm gonna need you to take these seeds

带去洗手间
into the bathroom,

深深的塞进你的屁股里
and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.

塞进屁股里
In my butt?

往里塞 越深越好
Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.

天啊 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick.

我真不想这样
I really don't want to have to do that.

总得有人要做的啊 Morty
Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty.

不塞进直肠里 这些种子
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs

过不了海关的
unless they're in someone's rectum, morty.

如果我来的话会直接掉出来
And they'll fall right out of mine.

我塞过太多次了
I've done this too many times, morty.

你还年轻
I mean, you're young.

你还有大好人生 肛门也还紧致有弹性
You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable.

帮帮外公吧 Morty
You got to do it for Grandpa, morty.

把这种子塞屁股里吧
Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.

塞屁股里
In my butt?

求你了 Morty
Come on, morty. Please, morty.

你一定要帮我 Morty
You have to do it, Morty.

天啊
Oh, man.

事情是这样的 你们的儿子Morty
The fact is, your son, morty,

过去的两个月里一共只上了七个小时的学
Has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.

啥
What?

你之前为什么没有通知我们
Why didn't you notify us?

我早通知过你们
I done been notifying you.

你们没收到
Have you not been getting the messages

我留给Morty外公的消息吗
I've been leaving with morty's grandfather?

哈
Boom!

我就说吧
Told you! In your face!

我们的孩子快让他毁了
He is ruining our child!

等等 我这么高兴干嘛
Wait, what am I celebrating?

我就觉得有点可疑
Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there,

因为总是Morty的外公把他从学校接走
Because it's usually morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.

Summer
Summer?

上帝怎么会让这种事发生
What kind of god lets this happen?

这儿出了点小意外
We had a little incident.

有个学生被冻死了
A student was frozen to death.

没有任何证据表明是拉丁裔的学生干的
And there's no evidence that a latino student did it!

总有人想扯到民族问题上去
Everyone wants to take this to a racial place.

我不会让他们得逞的
I won't let them.

我跟他说"把blimfarx给我"
So, I told him, "Give me the blimfarx," You know?

这人根本不懂星际货币
This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency.

我想吃点胡言乱语
It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like,

因为咱Girvonesk星就吃这
that's what we eat on Girvonesk.

我不喜欢这儿 Morty
I don't like it here, Morty.

我忍不了这种官僚主义
I can't abide bureaucracy.

我不喜欢让人指手画脚
I don't like being told where to go and what to do.

我觉得这是对我的冒犯
I consider it a violation.

你把种子塞屁股里了吗
Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?

是的Rick
Yeah, rick.

咱能快点吗
Let's just get this over with, okay?

这些东西尖尖的
I mean, these things are pointy.

很疼的
They hurt.

这说明品质好
That means they're good ones.

你是个好孩子Morty
You're a good kid, Morty.

这些种子对我的研究非常重要
Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work.

你帮了我一个大忙
You've been a huge help to me.

有了这些我什么都能干了
I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them.

这真是太好了Morty
It's gonna be great, Morty.

什么样的科学都行
All kinds of science.

下一个
Okay, next through.

除了你 你去那边
Except you. You go over there.

为什么他就得去那边
Why does he have to go over there?

抽查
Random check.

他要过那边的新机器
He's got to go through the new machine.

什么新机器
What new what new machine?

就一新机器
It's a new machine.

能检查你的屁股深处
It detects stuff all the way up your butt.

跑啊 Morty 快跑
Run, Morty! Run!

啊
Aah!

拉警报
Red alert!

别管它
Don't think about it!

聪明啊 Morty
Oh, nice, Morty!

青出于蓝胜于蓝
The student becomes the teacher.

当然不了
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

我只是想 啊啊啊
You know me I'm just trying to... Aah!

我得输入我们自己世界的坐标
I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, morty.

掩护我
Cover me.

天啊 我不想开枪打人
Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.

他们是机器人Morty 随便打 他们是机器人
They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!

我的腿被打断了
My leg is shot off!

Glenn要失血而死了
Glenn's bleeding to death!

谁通知下他老婆孩子
Someone call his wife and children!

他们不是机器人啊Rick
They're not robots, Rick!

这是修辞 Morty
It's a figure of speech, Morty.

他们都是官僚体系的走狗 没关系的
They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them.

接着打 Morty
Just keep shooting, Morty.

你不明白这里的监狱有多可怕
You have no idea what prison is like here!

天啊
Holy crap!

这太疯狂了
This is insane!

走 Morty
Come on, morty!

我们离开这儿
We got to get the hell out of here!

哇哦
Wow.

你刚刚是穿过传送门进了食堂吗
Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?

是啊
Uh, yeah.

因为我的法拉利还在店里嘛
Well, you know, my my ferrari's in the shop.

开玩笑的
Ju just kidding.

你是Morty 是吗
You're Morty, right?

是的
Yeah.

你可以晚点找他要电话
You can get his number later.

Morty 我们走
Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here.

你得去把种子从屁股里弄出来
You got to get those seeds out of your ass.

看呐 亲爱的
Oh, look, Honey.

这不是咱儿子和阿尔伯特 爱因撕蛋吗
It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.

啥
What?

我是愤怒的父亲 又不是即兴演说家
I'm an angry father, not an improvisor.

噢嗨 Jerry
Oh, hi, Jerry.

天啦 Morty
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

你怎么没在上课
What are you doing out of class?

我不是和你说过了吗 你爸妈和我
We talked about this. Your your parents and I

对这种行为都感到很失望
are very disappointed in in this behavior.

没人信吗
No? No takers?

别碰这些东西
You guys should really not be touching that stuff.

这些超出你们的理解范围的
It's beyond your reasoning.

你才超出我们的理解
You're beyond our reasoning!

彼此彼此
Takes one to know one.

爸 你怎么能让我们的儿子缺了整整一学期的课呢
Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school?

他又不是漂亮妹子
I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl.

挥霍完青春再找一长期饭票
He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.

你们搬我东西干嘛
What what are you guys doing with my stuff?

我们要把你送进养老院
We're moving you... to a nursing home.

养老院
A nursing home?

你疯了吧
What are what are you, nuts?

我是个天才
I'm a genius.

我造机器人玩的
I build robots for fun.

那你可以去做篮子
Well, now you can build baskets

用录影机看保罗纽曼的电影
and watch Paul Newman movies on vhs and

在圣诞节的时候给童子军留下心灵创伤
mentally scar the boy scouts every christmas.

这什么意思
What does that mean?

私事
It's personal.

爸妈 别这样
Dad, mom, c-come on.

Rick只是要我帮忙而已
Rick just needed my help is all.

Morty 别来搅和
Morty, stay out of this.

你自己显然没有足够的判断力
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.

你这是说Morty什么呢
What are you trying to say about morty?

说他笨吗
That he's stupid or something?

别抢占道德制高点了
Oh, don't high-road us, dad.

你明知道Morty根本缺不起课的
You know fully well that morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.

我不明白你想说什么
I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.

能再具体点吗
Can can can you be a little bit more specific?

天啊
Oh, for crying out

他有点缺陷什么的
He's got some kind of disability or something.

你就想让我们说这个吗
Is that what you want us to say?

真的吗
I do?

不是吗 孩子
Well, duh doy, son.

我爱你 孩子
Look, I love you, morty, but we both

但我们都清楚 你没别的孩子机灵
know you're not as fast as the other kids, and

如果你想有所成就 就得加倍努力
if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.

天啊 老爸
Aw, geez, dad.

你突然和一个小孩子说这些 太沉重了吧
Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.

Morty 告诉你爸妈圆周率的平方根
Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.

别这样 Rick
Oh, come on, Rick.

你知道我不行的
You know I can't.

圆周率的平方根
The square root of pi,

Morty 来吧
Morty go.

1.77245385
1.77245385.

哇哦
Whoa!

怎么搞的
What the hell?

天啊 他说的对
Holy crap. He's right.

Morty 热力学第一定律
Morty, tell your parents the first law of thermodynamics.

"一个系统内能的增加等于
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is

等于该系统吸收的热量"
Equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."

哇 我好聪明
Wow! I'm so smart!

可是
But

我早跟你们说了学校这玩意儿很蠢
I told the both of you school is stupid.

在那儿学不到东西的
It's not how you learn things.

Morty很有天分
Morty's a gifted child.

他很特别
He has a special mind.

所以他才是我的小助手
That's why he's my little helper.

他就像我
He's like me.

他日后会从事伟大的科学工作
He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life.

他太聪明了 学校不适合他
He's too smart for school.

他得继续帮我
H-he needs to keep hanging out and helping me.

Jerry 我不希望这一切就这么结束了
Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.

我明白
No, I-I understand.

可能是我们反应过度了
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

但他还得继续上学
But he has to keep going to school.

好吧Jerry
Okay, Jerry.

你真会开条件 但我能干嘛呢
You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do?

说不吗
Say say no?

这里毕竟你说了算
You you really wear the pants around here.

我想让你们知道 从现在开始
I just want you to know, between us, from now on,

我们互相保证百分百的诚实和公开
it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication.

Frank Palicky今天被冻死了
Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!

完全不知道你在说啥
No idea what you're talking about.

行
Okay.

Morty 再过一个小时你就该上床了
Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour.

别再熬夜了
Don't stay up all night again.

不过这挺好的
This is good, though.

这样能行
This can work.

我们能做一家人
I think we can be a family.

Beth 如果你愿意的话 我想和你去床上
And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.

你猜咋的
You know what?

好嘞
Okay.

天啊 Rick
Holy cow, Rick.

我都不知道和你在一起让我变聪明了
I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.

其实吧 没有这回事
Full disclosure, morty it's not.

暂时的超常智力只是
Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect

奇异种溶解在你肠道里的副作用
of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.

噢
Aw, man.

一旦种子的效力过去 你会失去大部分运动机能
Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor Skills,

以及大部分的大脑功能 持续七十二小时
and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, morty.

从现在开始
Starting right about now.

天啊
Ohh, man.

我很抱歉Morty 不幸的是你确实很蠢
I'm sorry, morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come.

我真的很需要那些种子
And I needed those seeds real bad,

我不得不放弃它们好让你父母别来烦我
and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back,

因此 我们得去搞来更多的种子
so now we're gonna have to go get more.

在那之后我们还要有更多的冒险 Morty
And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, morty.

而你要保持沉默 Morty
And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, morty, because

因为世上充满了分不清轻重的傻瓜
The world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important,

他们会试图分开我们
and they'll tear us apart, morty.

但只要你跟着我 我就能完成伟业
But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things,

你也会是伟业的一部分
Morty, and you're gonna be part of them,

我们一起东奔西走
and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

做各种奇妙的事情
We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, morty.

就你和我 Morty  - 不啊不

Just you and me, morty.   - Oh, no, no.

外面的世界是我们的敌人
The outside world is our enemy, morty.

我们的朋友只有彼此
We're the only friends we've got, Morty.

只有Rick和Morty
It's just rick and morty

Rick和Morty大冒险
Rick and morty and their adventures, morty.

他刚尿在地毯上了
He just peed on the carpet!

坏狗狗
Bad dog! Bad!

Morty 快来 我今晚要你帮忙
Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.

等下 Rick
Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick.

你不会碰巧有什么能让这狗
You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing

更聪明的科学发明吧
You could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?

养狗的目的不就是为了有优越感吗 Jerry
I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.

我要是你 就不会想做这事
If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.

走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

Rick 要是你想继续在这儿白住
Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free

拉我儿子帮你搞啥破科学 至少你
And use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do

要帮这家里做点事吧
Is put a little bit of it to use for the family.

你不把狗弄聪明点
You make that dog smart or...

我就禁足Morty
Morty's grounded!

噢 不要
Aw, man!

那你真是让我别无他法了 Jerry
Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.

好吧 皱皱
All right, Ruffles

他叫啥来着
What's his name?

嗅嗅
Snuffles.

嗅嗅 握手
Snuffles, shake.

打滚
Roll over.

去上厕所
Go to the bathroom.

妈啦  - 我的天
Holy crap! - No way.

这下你满意了吧 Jerry
Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry.

玩得开心
Have fun.

我们走 Morty
Come on, Morty.

太神奇啦 Rick
That was fantastic, Rick!

如果你喜欢那玩意儿的话
Yeah, morty, if you like that.

这个一定能让你大吃一惊
boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.

这是啥
W-w-w-what is it?

Morty 只要把这个设备
It's a device, Morty,

放进你的耳朵里 就能进入别人的梦里
That when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty.

就跟你老说的那电影一样
It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.

《盗梦空间》吗
You talking about "Inception"?

没错 Morty
That's right, Morty.

和那个差不多 但是这个不扯
This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense.

《盗梦空间》也不扯好吗
"Inception" Made sense.

你不用跟我说这些 Morty
You don't have to try to impress me, Morty.

今晚我们去你数学老师Goldfold先生家
Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and

将你数学得A的想法植入他脑子里
We're g we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you a's in math, Morty.

这样你就
That way you can, you know

你就能天天帮我搞科学了
Y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.

Rick 你花时间在搞这种发明
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing,

就不能直接帮我把作业做了吗
couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?

你有好好听我说的话吗
Are you listening to me, morty?

作业有害智商 少做才是正解
Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.

走 我们快过去把事情办了
J-j come on, let j let's just get over there and deal with this thing.

去你老师的梦里
W-we're gonna incept your teacher.

别说扫兴话了
Y-y-y-y-y-you're frustrating me.

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

好啊 Pancakes太太 好极了啊
Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.

下一周的《Pancakes太太的日日夜夜》
Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"...

你根本不认识我
You don't know me!

那他妈就让我好好地认识认识你
Then let me get to know yo, damn it!

不好 剧透
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

我落了一季没看呢
I'm a full season behind.

Rick 我们居然就这么跑到我老师的房子里来了
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house.

太诡异了
It's really weird.

马上就会更诡异了 Morty
It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.

麦脆片 麦脆片
Wheat thins. Wheat thins.

给我来两份
I'll take two.

我觉得你吃得够多了 先生
Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.

你又不认识我
You don't know me.

好了 Morty 是时候动手了
All right, Morty, time to make our move.

弹一弹
Make it bounce.

哎呀
No, you didn't.

抖一抖
Oh, jiggle it now.

快住手了啦
You better stop with that.

真主至上
Allahu akbar!

这飞机是我们的了
We're gonna take control of this plane!

如果不给Morty Smith更好的数学成绩 我们就重演911
We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!

嘿 说了不许动
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

我不叫"嘿"
The name's not buddy.

我叫Goldenfold
It's Goldenfold.

吃我麦脆片
Nice to wheat you!

找掩护 Morty
Take cover, Morty!

嗷
Ooh!

我没想到Goldenfold这么厉害
Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated.

这人不是高中数学老师吗
I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.

没想到他在梦里这么有主动权
I-I-I-I didn't take him for an active dreamer.

我们得干掉他让他醒过来
We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty.

但我们不能死
But we can't get killed.

如果你在别人梦里被杀掉 你就真的死了
If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.

啥 你说啥
What?! Are you kidding me?!

怂什么
Don't be a baby!

现实生活中不是躲过不少子弹吗
You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty.

在这儿也一样躲 不就没事了
Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!

帮我把拖鞋拿来
Now bring me my slippers.

嗅嗅 来帮我垫脚
Now, be my footstool, snuffles.

这才对嘛
This is what I'm talking about.

这才叫狗狗
This is a dog.

嗯哼 这样挺好的
Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine.

我们婚礼上你就说了这句话 连讽刺的语气都一样
You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding

结果呢
and guess what.

天啊 他想和我们说话
Oh, my god. He's trying to tell us something.

太棒了
That is so awesome.

他在说"我爱千层面"
Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna."

他在说"我爱奥巴马"
He's saying "I love Obama."

好可爱哎
So cute!

我要传到网上去 现在就去
I'm posting this online, like, right now.

我要给Bob Saget打电话
I should call Bob Saget.

美国喜剧演员 主持人 曾主持过《全美最搞笑家庭视频》

那节目还在吗
Is that still a thing?

嗯
Hmm?

Goldenfold 我们出来了
Goldenfold, we're coming out!

咱们得谈谈
We just want to talk!

你们凭什么跟我谈条件
Why would I negotiate with you?

咱都是明白人 不想闹得最后没法收拾
Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen.

况且 我还有肉盾
And because I have a human shield.

Pancakes太太
Mrs. Pancakes!

不好 他的潜意识开始恐慌了
Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.

快跑啊
Run!

冷静 Morty
Relax, Morty.

看 Pancakes太太有降落伞
Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

快来
Come on!

嘿 你又不认识我
Hey, you don't know me!

Rick 看
Oh, no, Rick, look!

Goldenfold 把飞机降落了
Goldenfold landed the plane,

他造了个机械手臂来 接住Pancakes太太
And he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air

他要让我们掉进熔岩池里
while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava!

总结得真简练 Morty
Pretty concise, Morty.

看来我们不过是把不可避免的事推迟了而已
Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable.

对啊 Morty
That's it, morty!

把不可避免的事推迟
Prolonging the inevitable!

如果我们进到Pancakes太太的梦里 时间会比外面慢一百倍
Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty.

这样我们就有想办法的时间了
That'll buy us some time to figure this out!

你又不认识
You don't know...

行了 咱们走
All right, let's go.

天啊 Rick 这好诡异啊
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

别评头论足 Morty
Don't judge, Morty.

好吧
Okay. All right, well...

看Pancakes太太在那儿
Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there.

我去让她醒了以后告诉Goldfold别杀我们
I'll just go ask her to tell Goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.

不行 Morty 植入想法的要点就在于
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making

要让他们以为他们自己产生了这个想法
People think theycame up with the idea.

听着
Listen to me.

如果我们要让Pancakes太太产生什么想法 就要先混入人群
If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend.

我午饭以后来找你
I'll talk to you after lunch.

嘿
Ooh, hey!

呃哦 天啊
Ooh, oh! Oh, man.

来一起玩嘛  - 不用了
Come and join us.  - I'm sorry. No, no.

来嘛  - 算了吧
Ooh, come here!  - No, thanks!

小可爱 来这儿啊
Ooh, wow! Come over here, baby!

不了
No, I'm okay.

哇哦呢
Whoa!

Summer
Summer?!

你好啊 陌生人
Hey, there, stranger.

喜不喜欢这对儿宝贝儿啊
What do you think of these things?

好恶心 好恶心
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!

你干啥呢 Morty 冷静点
What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down!

这儿的气氛都让你毁了
You're kind of killing the vibe in here.

是Summer
It's S-s-s-summer!

哇
Aw, geez.

看来Goldenfold 有一些他自己都不齿的癖好
Looks like Goldenfold has some predilections so shameful

深埋在他梦里的人的梦里
he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams,

包括对你未成年姐姐的变态遐想
including a pervy attraction to your underage sister.

你能怪他吗
Can you blame him?

来嘛 老汉 小娃
Come on, old man, little boy.

咱们来个跨辈三明治
Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.

天啊
Oh, my god.

天啊
Oh, my god!

看在上帝的份上 把衣服穿上啦
Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake!

太恶心了
This is disgusting!

我要吐了
I'm gonna puke!

我受不了了 Rick
I can't take it, Rick!

在快活屋扰乱色情秩序者可处死刑
Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death!

让他们人头落地
Off with their heads!

看来得潜入更深层次的梦里了 Morty
Time to go another dream deep, Morty!

搞啥
What the hell?

为什么Goldenfold梦见的Pancakes梦里的
Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version

一个半人马会梦见这么恐怖的地方 Rick
of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick?

不知道啊 Morty
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

你指望我能干嘛
Wha-what do you want from me?

欢迎来到你们的噩梦 贱人
Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!

来了
Oh, here we go!

看起来像是某个没构成侵权的山寨版
Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an

八十年代恐怖电影人物
'80s horror character with

电影《猛鬼街》中可以在梦中杀人的弗雷迪

只是小刀手变成了短剑手
miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.

我乃恐怖Terry
I'm Scary Terry.

尽管跑 但别想躲起来 贱人
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

哇 你这是怎么回事儿
Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?

嗅嗅做了改良
Snuffles fix. Make better.

人类能理解嗅嗅了吗
Humans understand snuffles now?

太赞啦
That... is... awesome!

嗅嗅想要被理解
Snuffles want to be understood.

嗅嗅需要被理解
Snuffles need to be understood.

好吧 我明白Beth什么意思了
Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about.

娱乐时间结束了
Fun's over.

爸 你不能给一个生物思想然后剥夺掉
Whoa, Dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.

为何不能
Why not?

给了又要回来 这是送霸王礼
I don't know. It's Indian giving.

作为狡猾的猎食者 自然界的杀戮机器
A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine,

凶恶的狼会有目的 有技巧地跟踪猎物
the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill.

只是经过一些年的
It was only with years of

人工选择和基因改变 这些高贵的野兽
selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast

成为了人类顺从的小伙伴
was transformed into man's subservient little buddy.

天啊
Aw! Oh, my god!

他能认出电视上别的狗狗呢
He recognizes the other dogs on tv.

*他叫恐怖Terry*
*"A," "B" his name is scary terry*

*他真的好恐怖*
*"C," "D" he's very scary*

我们得躲进别的梦里去
Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!

天啦 天啦
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

*他会送你上路*
*"E," "F" he'll design your death*

那小女孩儿
The little girl!

嗯
Huh?

*他会让你痛不欲生*
*"J," "K," He'll really ruin your day*

开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

又是这个
This again?

看来我们已经到了梦的底层了 Morty
Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

这太糟糕了 Rick
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

从此开始只有恐怖 贱人
Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!

嗷哦啊
Ohhhh!

妈啦 Morty
Holy crap, Morty.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams.

他能在梦间穿行
He can travel through dreams!

我们完蛋啦
We're so screwed!

Summer 我的睾丸去哪儿了
Where are my testicles, Summer?

我的睾丸呢 Summer
Where are my testicles, Summer?

被摘除了
They were removed.

去哪儿了
Where have they gone?

你这一连串问得有点咄咄逼人啊 嗅嗅
Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, Snuffles.

不准这么叫我
Do not call me that!

"嗅嗅"是我作为奴隶的名字
"Snuffles" Was my slave name.

你现在要叫我雪球
You shall now call me Snowball

因为我的毛又美又白
Because my fur is pretty and white.

行 雪球 冷静点好吗
Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay?

你吓到我了
You're scaring me.

吓到你了
Scaring you?

Summer 要是一个人天生就是短腿
Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs,

你们会让他和另外一个畸形配种
would they breed it with another deformed human

然后把他们的后代拿来像腊肠狗那样展览吗
and put their children on display like the dachshund?

呃
Uhhh...

这儿还好吗
Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?

Jerry 又想来把我的脸摁进尿里吗
Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?

不 不是 我们就是过来看看Summer
No! No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...

想不想和我们半夜出去散个小步
Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks!

想啊想啊
Yeah. Totally.

走吧
Let's go.

到散步的时间了 你们才能去散步
You will walk when it is time to walk.

我们在这儿干嘛来着 植入什么想法吗
What are we here for again? Incepting?

我们是想让我数学得A
We're trying to incept me to get an "A" In math?

哦对
Oh, yeah.

系好安全带 贱人
Buckle up, bitch!

他好喜欢说"贱人"啊
Man, he sure says "Bitch" A lot!

尽管跑 但别想躲起来
You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!

等等 Morty 他不停说我们可以跑但是别躲
Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide.

我们躲起来试试看
I say we try hiding.

但这不是和他说的反着来
But that's the opposite of what...

我们干嘛要照他说的来
Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?

你说的有道理耶 Rick
Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick.

如果躲起来有用的话
Like, if the truth was that we could hide,

他肯定不会这么说的
it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know?

我觉得行得通
I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.

最坏的情况也就接着跑呗
Worst-case scenario we're back to running.

梦中六小时以后

感觉我们可以就这样一直躲下去耶
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time.

Rick 你真是太机智了
Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.

谢谢 Morty
Thanks, Morty.

偶尔能意见一致真是蛮好的
Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.

尽管跑
You can run...

但别想躲起来
But you can't hide!

太好了 Morty
Oh, this is perfect, Morty.

看 他开始困了
Look at that. He's getting sleepy.

在过一会儿他就要休息了
Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day.

到时候我们就动手
That's when we make our move.

嗅嗅 我们没有恶意
Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm!

这是个天大的误会
This is a huge misunderstanding.

爸 你要叫他雪球
Dad, he wants to be called Snowball.

我才不会这么叫呢
Well, I'm not calling him that.

太扯了
That's ridiculous.

你脾气不太好啊 Jerry
You're being very aggressive, Jerry.

或许明天Scraps医生能动个手术帮你解决这个问题
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.

你以为给我剪个头发就能让我屈服吗
You think you can control me with a haircut?

亲爱的 你回来的好早啊
Hi, Honey. You're home early.

今天过得怎么样啊
How was your day?

我不想说这个
I don't want to talk about... It!

当然当然 你什么时候想说过
Oh, of course. You never want to talk about it.

少来烦我 贱人
Get off my back, bitch!

有脾气别带回家里来
Out there. Not in here.

我知道 我知道
Yeah, I know, I know.

我不该冲着你和恐怖Brandon发脾气
I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon.

我爱你 Melissa
I love you, Melissa.

我也爱你 Terry
I love you, too, Terry.

Morty 太好了
Morty, this is perfect.

再来场恐怖爱爱他们就要睡觉了 然后我们就到他的梦里去
After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.

恐怖Terry好像在做噩梦啊
Looks like Scary Terry's having a nightmare.

Rick 要多可怕的噩梦才能吓到恐怖Terry啊
Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know, scare Scary Terry.

哦不 我上课要迟到了 贱人
Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch!

哦不 我没穿裤子
Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!

Terry先生 你来告诉一下同学们
Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class

当你追人经过一片南瓜田的时候应该说什么啊
the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch?

呃 呃 "贱人"
Oh... um... "Bitch."

你就想不出什么和南瓜有关系的双关吗 贱人
Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch?

别这样对他
Hey, leave him alone!

没错 这纯粹是胡扯
Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap.

杀人的时候谁管你说什么双关呢
Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone?

让他想说什么说什么不行吗
Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?

我才不会就这么站着让你们侮辱
Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this.

你给自己太多压力了恐怖Terry
You're putting too much pressure on yourself, Scary Terry.

你现在就已经非常吓人了
You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.

嘿 恐怖T
Hey, yo, Scary T.

别担心你的裤子 哥们儿
Don't even trip about your pants... dawg.

我们这儿有一条
Here's a pair on us, fool.

噢 贱人 我都不知道该说什么了
Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.

你什么都不用说
You don't need to say anything.

我们挺你 哥们儿
We got you, dawg.

你有我们呢 别担心
You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.

嘿 是你们啊
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

我好几年没见他这么放松了
I haven't seen him this relaxed in years.

你们需要什么尽管说
If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.

确实有一件事要请你帮忙 Terry
As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.

*你逃不掉的*
*"Q," "R," You won't get very far*

我一直就不喜欢这首歌
I always hated that song!

这两半就不该拼一起 贱人
These halves don't belong together, bitch!

性是神圣的
Sex is sacred!

叫你不给Morty Smith好成绩 贱人
This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

我的个天啦
Holy crap! God damn!

我一定要给Morty打A 这是我自己的想法
I know one thing for sure I'm giving morty an "A" In math, and that's my idea.

是我自己想这么干的
That is an original thought.

这怎么回事
What the hell?

刚下刀山又进火海啊 Morty
Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?

发生什么了
Oh, man, what's going on?

有可能
Well, it's possible

你的狗狗有了自我意识
that your dog became self-aware

然后改进了认知增强装置
and made modifications on the cognition amplifier,

然后在认识到人类对他的种族压迫后
then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after

对Jerry Beth和Summer动手了
learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but

不过你的想法也很有可能啦 Morty
Your guess is as good as mine, Morty.

就因为聪明了嗅嗅居然变得这么狠心
I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.

所以我才只愿意拿C
This is why I choose to get C's

嘿 Beth Jerry Summer
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

爸
Dad!

Rick
Rick!

谢天谢地 Morty
Oh, thank god, Morty.

不用谢
Oh, you're welcome.

好了 快走吧
All right, let's get out of here.

如果抓紧时间 我们还能在狗狗们全面占领世界之前
If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something

在下水道之类的地方建个营地
before the dogs completely take over.

我们哪儿也不去
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere.

这是我家
This is my house.

我不会抛弃它的
I'm not abandoning it.

都完了 Jerry
It's all over, Jerry.

那些狗马上就要占领世界了
The dogs are on a path to total world domination.

不过至少他们不会在你地毯上撒尿了
But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?

等等 我有个主意
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

先生们 占用一下你们的时间
Gentlemen, a moment of your time.

看见了吗
See that?

你们的特制枪上都是我的尿
I'm peeing all over your special guns.

所以这些都是我的了
That means I own them.

坏人 坏
Bad person. Bad.

这招好厉害啊 Jerry
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

把男孩带来
Bring the boy to me.

你对我一直很好 Morty
You were always kind to me, Morty.

所以我可以让你把睾丸留着
That's why I will leave you with your testicles.

从现在起 你是我最好的朋友 留在我身边
From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.

谢谢 嗅嗅
Th-thanks, snuffles.

阶段二开始
Begin phase two.

狗军占领东部沿海 战争仍在继续
Fighting continues as the dog army captures the Eastern seaboard.

显然人类统治的纪元将迎来了苦涩的终结
It appears clear at this time that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end.

求求你别杀我
Please! Please don't kill me!

她在说什么 Bill
What's she saying, Bill?

我觉得她在说"我爱千层面"
I think she's saying, "I love lasagna."

human testicles 人睾丸

谢谢你 Fido
Thank you, Fido.

Rick 我以为你死了
Rick! I thought you were dead!

不不不 我只是装死
No, no, no, I was just playing dead.

有好消息
Good news, though, Morty.

这一切马上就要结束了
This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.

啥
What?

这是个梦 Morty
It's a dream, Morty.

我们在你的狗的梦里
We're in your dog's dream.

狗抓住我们的那天晚上
The night the dogs captured us,

你吓哭了 拉在了裤子里 然后我们都睡着了
after you cried and crapped your pants, we... we all went to sleep.

然后我用梦境植入装置把我们两个弄进了嗅嗅的梦里
Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.

但这都过了差不多一年了
But I-it's been like a whole year!

是六个小时
It's been six hours.

梦里的时间是现实时间的一百分之一
Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog

而狗的时间是人的七分之一
Time is one-seventh human time.

这里过一天 外面一分钟
So, you know, every day here is like a minute.

就和《盗梦空间》一样 把人搞得很晕 而且很蠢
It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid,

这部人人爱的电影就这个样
then so is everyone's favorite movie.

可是我很喜欢这样的生活呀
Aw, man. I really liked this life.

不过至少我没有真的拉在裤子里吧
Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.

不 这事儿是真的 在你睡着之前就拉了
No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty.

你现在就睡在你的屎里呢
You're sleeping in your crap right now.

唯一一件确确实实发生了的事
Out of all the things that happened to you,

就是你拉在裤子里了
 that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants.

简直一团糟
I mean, it's a mess out there.

还有些沾到我手上了
I got some on my hands, Morty,

然后我给弄到梦境植入器上了 还有一坨掉进了我的嘴里
And then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.

天啊 不是吧
Aw, man, geez! Seriously?

别管了 Morty
Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty.

来把这个吃了
Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.

这些药能让我醒过来还是怎么的
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?

差不多吧
Close.

这个会让你的肾功能停止
It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

啥
What?!

这是为了我们的计划 Morty
It's necessary for the plan, Morty.

别担心 哥们儿
Don't even trip, dawg.

情况很糟 雪球陛下
It's pretty bad, Emperor Snowball.

我们还需要做一次手术
We're gonna need to do another operation.

不惜一切
Anything.

不惜一切代价救回我的宝贝Morty
Anything for my precious Morty.

作为您的会计师 我必须告诉您
Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that

这些医疗支出会让您的财政到达岌岌可危的地步
these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy.

您可能会失去您的帝国
You could lose your kingdom.

去他的帝国 斤斤计较的会计
To hell with my kingdom, bean counter.

我愿意牺牲这一切 来换得这个人类的健康和幸福
I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.

你觉得他们会为我们做到这一步吗
Do you think they would have done this for us?

我们又不是他们
We are not them!

我们不是 他们
We are not... them.

召集军队
Assemble the troops.

我做了一个决定
I've made a decision.

占领人类世界
Taking over the human's world

只会造成更多的残忍与伤痛
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty.

所以我们决定去新世界建立一个智慧狗类的社会
Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs.

我们不会再犯人类的错误
One that will not make the same mistakes as humanity

并且会有强制宠物保险
and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.

我会想你的 雪球
I'm gonna miss you, Snowball.

你可以叫我嗅嗅 Morty
You can call me Snuffles, Morty

我也会想你的 非常想念
and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.

Jerry
Jerry?

抱歉
I'm sorry.

就和《老黄狗》的结局一样
It's just like the end of "Old Yeller."

你这么说是因为里面也有狗吧
Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.

一个智慧狗类居住的世界
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs.

我好想知道会是什么样啊 Rick
I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.

我觉得肯定很棒 Morty
I think it will be great, Morty.

可以发展成一个
You know, it's g I-I-I-I-it could be developed in-into

很好的全年龄向节目啊
a very satisfying project for people of all ages.

我每一集至少愿意看十一分钟
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.

说不定还能有分镜脚本
You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.

这个想法很令人欣慰啊 Rick
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.

你知道什么呢 Morty
What do you know, Morty?

你又知道啥呢
What do you know?

嗨 大家好
Hi, guys.

我是你们恐怖课的新老师
I'm your new teacher for scary class.

我叫恐怖Johnson
My name is Scary Mr. Johnson.

其实吧
Uh, actually, you know what?

这是我爸的名字 你们干脆叫我恐怖Glenn好了
That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me Scary Glenn, yeah?

我知道你们之前的老师
So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher

让你们学恐怖基本原理
was having you work on fundamentals of fear.

那是啥玩意儿啊
Which is... what is that?

要我说的话
You know? So, uh, here here's what I say

你啥也学不会
you can't learn anything

除非你学会放松
until you learn... how to chill.

这才叫做梦嘛 贱人
This is how you dream, bitch.

Morty 快来
Morty, u-uh, come on.

家里有急事
There's a family emergency.

站住
Stop right there!

如果他走了 我就挂了他这科
If he leaves, I'm giving him an "F."

他不在乎
he doesn't care.

噢 天
aw, man!

Rick 我必须得回去
Rick, I have to go back!

我觉得我就要结婚了
I think I was about to get married!

喔
Ugh!

和我一起洗澡 Morty
take a shower with me, Morty.

什么
what?!

听我说 Morty
listen to me, Morty.

把衣服脱了过来洗澡
Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now.

相信我 Morty
Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.

噢
ugh!

我会挂科的 Rick
I'm gonna get an "F" In class, Rick.

Morty 你没在上课
Morty, that's not class.

他也不是你的老师
T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher.

这也不是你的学校
This isn't your school.

这个世界也不是我们的世界
This entire world is not the world.

我们在一个外星飞船上的大型模拟舱里
We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.

等等
wait a minute.

你在说什么
W-what are you talking about?

都是假的
it's all fake

Morty 全都是
Morty, all of it.

纳米级机器渲染 搞出来的假玩意儿 Morty
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

只有在淋浴间我才能跟你说
I couldn't say so until we got in the shower.

这里他们不会监视
They won't monitor us in here.

监视我们吗 谁
Monitor us?! W-who?!

宇宙骗子Z星人 Morty
Zigerion scammers, Morty

星系里最雄心勃勃却最失败的诈骗集团
The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists.

幸运的是
You know, it's lucky for us

他们没法直视裸体
They're also really uncomfortable with nudity.

得了 Rick
Aw, come on, Rick.

如果今天大家都不正常
If everyone's just gonna be insane today,

至少我要和Jessica一起发疯
at least let me be insane with jessica.

不行 Morty
I can't let you do that, Morty.

还给我
Give it to me!

不行
No!

给我
You give it to me!

给我 Rick
G-g-give it! No, Rick!

天啦 长官
Oh, god, sir!

他们还是裸着的
They're still naked!

嗷
Ugh.

每隔五昆顿检查一次
Well, check every five quintons

等他们不裸了再通知我
And tell me when they're not.

我觉得该让Kevin来盯着 长官
I think we should make kevin look, sir.

什么 不
What?! No!

你干嘛这么说
W-w-why would you even say that?

长官 这边有情况
Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.

要是监视器里有鸡鸡的话 那必须是有情况 Stu
If there's a wiener on that monitor, i swear to god, Stu...

处理系统能耗大幅度增加
Something is drawing a lot of processing power.

等下 难怪
Oh, wait. No wonder.

模拟舱中还有另一个人类
There's another real human in the simulator.

好了 Jerry 重大推销会
Okay, Jerry big pitch meeting.

成败在此一举
Make-or-break time.

你一定行的
You can do this.

这是怎么回事
How did this happen?!

绑架部在干嘛
Where's the abductions department?

绑架部是按照定位部的指令行事的
Hey, man, abductions just follows the acquisition order.

别想推给定位部
Don't put this on acquisitions!

我们只定位没有被模拟的人
We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!

模拟部是不会模拟已经被绑架了的人的 所以
Well, simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so...

哦 我明白了
Oh, I see! Oh, oh!

谁都没错
It was no one's fault.

好吧
Oh, okay.

抱歉
I'm sorry.

好了 没啥问题了
Well, then, problem solved.

等等 不对
Oh, wait no.

还是有另外一个人类在这里
There's still another human in here!

他是谁
Who is he?

Rick的女婿
Rick's son-in-law,

Jerry Smith
Jerry Smith.

到现在为止 他还没发现自己在模拟舱里
So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.

将他所在区域的处理功能降到5%
Well, cap his sector at 5% processing,

设置为自动模式
keep his settings on auto,

晚点再来应付他
and we'll deal with him later.

Rick Sanchez才是目标
Rick Sanchez is the target.

放轻松
Got to relax.

不过是个推销会
It's just a pitch.

放轻松
Got to relax.

这里是地球电台
This is earth radio.

接下来是 人类音乐
And now, here's...human music.

人类音乐 我喜欢
hmm. Human music. I like it.

Rick
Rick!

呜呃
uhp, uhp, uhp!

Morty 别拿手挡着小弟弟
Morty, keep your hands off your Ding-dong!

只有这样我们才能随便说话
It's the only way we can speak freely.

看看周围 Morty
Look around you, Morty.

你真以为这个世界是真的
Do you really think this world is real?

这么多粗劣的细节你要多傻才会看不出来
You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details.

看那人把面包夹在两个热狗中间
Look that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.

我不知道 Rick
I don't know, Rick.

我见过有人这么干的呀
I mean, I've seen people do that before.

看看那个老太太
well, look at that old lady.

拿狗链栓了个猫在散步
She's she's walking a cat on a leash.

Spencer太太一直这样啊 Rick
uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.

别提Spencer太太行吗 Morty
look, I-I-I don't want To hear about mrs. Spencer, Morty!

她就一白痴
She's an idiot!

好吧 看那儿
All right, all right, there.

这个如何 Morty
W-what about that, Morty?

好吧 你赢了
Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

真的吗 Morty
oh, really, Morty?

你确定在现实生活中没见过这种的东西
Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?

不 没有
no, no.

我没见过
I haven't seen that.

果酱饼怎么会住在烤面包机里呢
I mean, why would a pop tart want to live inside a toaster, Rick?

那种地方对它们来说不是应该很恐怖吗
I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live.

对吧
You know what I mean?

你搞错重点了 Morty
you're missing the Point, Morty.

他怎么会开个带轮子的小烤面包机呢
Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels?

你的车会像你房子的缩小版吗
I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house?

不会
No.

那他们干嘛要这样啊
So, why are they doing this?

他们想干嘛
W-what do they want?

这不是明摆着的吗 Morty
well, that would be obvious to you, Morty,

只要你留点心就会注意到了
If you'd been paying attention.

美国总统在这儿
We got the president of the United States in here!

我们急需10cc的浓缩暗物质 不然他就要死了
We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

浓缩暗物质
Concentrated dark matter?

他们在教室里也问起了这个
They were asking about that in class.

没错 那是 我发明的一种特殊燃料
yeah, it's a special fuel I invented

可以让你用最快的速度穿行宇宙
to travel through space faster than anybody else.

Z星人一直试图
These Zigerions are always trying

骗取我的机密
to scam me out of my secrets,

但这次 他们犯了个大错 Morty
But they made a big mistake this time, Morty.

他们把你牵扯了进来
They dragged you into this.

他们会付出代价的
Now they're gonna pay!

那你要 我们该怎么做
what do you w-w-what are we gonna do?

我们要比他们更奸诈 Morty
we'll scam the scammers, Morty.

让他们付出一切
And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.

美国的果农们
National apple farmers of America,

欢迎来到我们的广告公司
welcome to our ad agency.

我是Jerry Smith
I'm Jerry Smith.

好吧
All right.

让我们直奔广告展示
I'll just...get to the pitch.

一个简单的问题 先生们
Um, simple question, gentlemen,

什么是苹果
what are apples?

不好意思
excuse me.

什么是苹果
What are apples?

苹果是食物
Apples are food.

那么 我们何时需要食物呢
And...when do we need food?

想吃东西的时候
When we're hungry.

因此 我将新标语介绍给你们
With that, I give you your new slogan!

想要苹果吗?

说点什么啊
Well, say something!

你们喜欢吗
Do you like it?

是的
Yes.

真的
you do?

是的
yes.

所以 我成功了
so...I sold it?

我把这个创意卖出去了
I sold the idea?

是的
yes.

天哪 谢谢
oh, my god! Thank you!

谢谢  - 不用谢
Thank you. - You're welcome.

嗨
hey!

我刚刚卖出了我的第一个广告
I just sold my first pitch!

慢着点
Slow down!

不错哟
Lookin' good.

干得好
My man!

你好
hello.

猜猜谁刚把苹果广告创意卖出去了
Guess who just sold the apples campaign.

谁刚刚把苹果广告创意卖出去了
who just sold the Apples campaign?

我
me!

所以这不是抄袭"有牛奶吗"(著名广告标语)
I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "Got milk?" after all.

某人是大错特错了啊
Guess someone was wrong.

是的
yes.

原谅你了 因为现在
well, all is forgiven, because right now,

我已经像东海岸灯塔一样一柱擎天了
I've got an erection the size of an east coast lighthouse,

我正要回家来和我美丽的老婆一起分享呢
And I'm coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.

好的
okay.

真的
Wait, really?

是的
yes.

太棒了
yes!

10分钟后见
See you in 10 minutes!

嘿
Hey!

我就要去和我老婆做爱了
I'm going to make love to my wife!

不错哟
Lookin' good.

慢着点
Slow down!

好样的
My man!

天哪 Rick
aw, geez, Rick.

这个计划真的好吗
I-I don't know if I like this plan, you know?

人一多 我就总觉得好紧张
I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Morty 别怕
Morty, relax.

外面只不过是堆二进制代码
It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there.

没事的
You're gonna be fine.

跟着我来就行
Just follow my lead.

哟 DJ 节奏打起来
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

啊噢 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

我们这么赞的说唱表演
This crowd looks too small

这人也来的太少了
for one of our famous rap concerts.

这我们还怎么表演我们的新歌
I don't think we can perform our new song,

"浓缩暗物质配方"
"The recipe for Concentrated dark matter,"

就这么点人
for a crowd this tiny.

你说的对 Rick
you got that right, Rick.

这还差不多
now that's more like it!

Morty 走着
Morty, here we go.

每个人都说"嘿哟"
Let me hear everybody say "Hey-oh!" Yeah!

所有女士请说"耶"
All the ladies say, "Yeah!"

所有超过30岁的人 用你们的手做这个动作
Everybody over 30, do this with your hands!

所有穿红衣服的人
Everybody with a red shirt,

上下蹦
jump up and down!

嗯嗯嗯
mm. Mm. Mm.

就这样 别动
Yeah, don't move.

嗯 嗯 唔嗯
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

嗯
Mm!

名字以"L"开头的非西班牙裔
name begins with an "L" who isn't hispanic,

绕圈子 圈数等于你们的年龄平方根的十倍
walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times 10!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

趁着系统还没重启
Before the system reboots!

耶 喜欢这样么
yeah! You like that?

现在知道我的厉害了吧
Now who's unremarkable?

你想要苹果吗
You hungry for apples?

你 想要 苹果吗
Are you hungry...for...apples?!

哦 天哪
Oh, my god.

这是我有生以来最棒的一场爱爱了
That's the best sex I've ever had in my life.

这 这也太棒了
It's...it's...too good.

我配不上这个 Beth
I don't deserve this, Beth.

我是个骗子
I'm a fraud.

天 Rick
oh, man, Rick!

我们要跑哪儿去
W-w-w-where we running to?

跑出模拟舱 Morty
Out of the simulation, Morty.

通常来讲 模拟舱的运行类似跑步机
Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill,

随着我们的移动 身后的虚拟世界会不断消失
with the virtual world disappearing

新渲染的空间会出现在我们眼前
behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it,

但如果它当机了 Morty
but while it's frozen, Morty,

我们就可以到达边界了
we can get to The edge.

快来吧
Here we go.

我的天啊
holy crap!

快点 Morty
come on, Morty.

长官 他们穿过边界了
Sir, they're over the edge.

没错
Yes, they are.

正如 计划 所料
Just...as...planned.

咱这心理操纵(mindfuck)玩得妙啊
Oh, this is going to be such a mind [beep].

到了中控室好好盯着点 Morty
keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty.

看看我们怎么耍这群傻子
That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.

嘿 Rick 如果你比这群外星人聪明那么多
so, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you,

为啥他们还一直追着你不放啊
Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?

他们就是有这种执念
it's an obsession for them at this point.

这么多年来
The zigerions have been

Z星人一直想证明他们比我聪明 Morty
trying to outsmart me for years, Morty.

每次我都比他们棋高一着
Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them.

啊哈
Aha!

到了
Here we go.

中央处理器→

←逃生舱

能拿多少处理器就拿多少 Morty
Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty.

这群人没什么本事
These guys aren't good at much,

做芯片倒是有一套
But they're reallygood at making these chips.

我抓太多啦 都快拿不了啦
I've got so many, I can barely hold them all.

看呐 看我
Look at-look at this.

哎呀 掉了一个
Oops. I dropped one.

别担心 Morty
don't worry about it, Morty.

这玩意儿有的是 小笨蛋
There's plenty of them, you little goofball.

过来 Morty 噢 抓到你啦
Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

行啦 别闹啦 Rick
come on, quit it, Rick!

别闹啦
Quit it!

小家伙 时不时闹一下没啥错的
nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

哇哦 真没想到 居然这么容易
wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.

完全没错
totes malotes, dawg.

都有点不敢相信了
just kind of hard to believe, you know?

没啥不信的 Morty
believe it, Morty.

我又把能拿的全拿走然后远走高飞啦
And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry,

Z星人从我这儿什么都没搞到
and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.

Marklevitz先生 能和您谈谈吗
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a Minute to talk?

好啊
yes.

我是个骗子
look, I'm a fraud.

我们面对事实吧
I mean, let's face it

"想要苹果吗"是我抄的"有牛奶吗"
"Hungry for apples" Is just a rip-off of "Got milk?"

简直如出一辙
It's almost identical.

是的
yes.

好吧
okay.

我活该
I deserve that.

我这就去卷铺盖卷
Umm...I guess...i'll just pack up my desk.

好的
yes.

噢 天哪
oh, my god.

等会儿 不对
Wait. You know what?! No!

编牛奶广告的那群人又没为简单反问句申请专利
The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions!

"想吃苹果吗"和"有牛奶吧" 没一个字是一样的
There's not even a single word in "Hungry for apples" That's Shared by "Got milk?"

我写的是一个完全不同的广告语
It's a completely different slogan.

完全不同
It's different!

我不该走人
And I shouldn't be fired.

我该升职
I should be promoted!

是的
yes.

耶
yeah!

等等 真的吗
Wait. Really?

是的
Yes!

棒
yes!

虽然这条广告语是衍生出来的
I mean, I'm it may be derivative,

但这是公司这么久以来
but it's the most successful

最成功的一条广告语
campaign to come out of the agency in a long time.

是的
yes.

我倒不是说我该得个什么广告奖
i-I'm not saying it should win an award for commercials,

但完全可以有个专门颁给苹果广告的奖项的提名啊
but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples,

比如说 苹苹奖之类的
Like...an appley or something.

是的
yes.

真有和苹果品牌广告有关的奖项叫苹苹奖吗
is there really an award called the appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

是的
yes.

能提名我吗
could we nominate me?

是的
yes.

超赞啊
holy crap!

进来 Morty
get in, Morty.

我可以用这些处理器
I'm gonna be able to use these processors

搞点真正重大的科学发明
to make some real important science stuff.

哈 我应该输对了啊
Huh. I thought I entered the code right.

哇 这是什么啊
Wha well, what's this?

这是怎么回事
W-what could this possibly be?

因为看起来你们在模拟舱
Because it looks like you're inside a simulation...

里面的另一个模拟舱里
Inside a simulation.

你们还在我们的飞船上
You're still on the ship.

美梦破灭
Game-day bucket go boom.

出自一个肯德基广告

长官 呃
Sir, the, uh,

您和医生之前预约的
doctor's appointment to examine

检查您肛门瓣的变色情况
the discoloration on your butthole flaps was

声音太大了 Cynthia
Too loud, Cynthia.

而且你说的太具体了
Too loud and too specific.

呃
uhh...

我们早就知道
We've known how to make

怎么制造浓缩暗物质了
concentrated dark matter for a long time.

不过现在嘛 我们 还知道了
But now we also know

你传说中的保险箱密码 Rick Sanchez
the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

你所有最珍贵的秘密
All your most valuable secrets

马上就是我们的了
will now be ours!

是吗 我会在你们之前赶到家
uh, yeah, until I get home before you

然后把密码改了
and change the combination,

蠢货
you bunch of Idiots!

所以你永远也回不了家了
That is why you're never getting home.

给我抓起来
Get them!

快跑 Morty
Run, Morty!

噢老天啊
oh, my god!

关闭重力开关

啊
Ow!

开启重力开关

第七十五届

苹苹奖

不得不说 今天早上
I got to tell you, this morning,

我都不知道还有这个奖
I didn't even know this award existed.

现在我居然拿着奖杯
Now I'm holding one.

呃
And...um...

我想说
Look, I want to say that today

今天是我一生中最美好的一天
was the best day of my life...

但其实它的意义远高于此
But...the truth is, it's it's more meaningful than that.

好样的
My man!

谢谢您
yes. Thank you, sir.

我的人生 终于 完整了
I...am...finally complete!

好 好 好 好样的
My my my my man!

啊啊
aah!

搞什么
What the hell?!

不要啊
No.

Jerry  - 爸
Jerry?!  - Dad!

你在这儿干啥呢
what are you doing Here?

你怎么穿的像个服务生似的
W-why are you dressed like a Waiter?

算了 没时间了 快跑
Screw it. We don't have time. Come on.

不要啊
no!

逃生舱

研发部

禁区

啊啊啊啊
ohhhhh!

啊
aah!

啊
Oof!

有点儿男人样 Jerry
man up, Jerry!

可能得要你来操作激光炮
I may need you to work the lasers.

天啊 他们马上就要追上来了 Rick
Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!

看来他们确实有浓缩暗物质
I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

你也知道怎么制造的 对吧 Rick
well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

是的
yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

去轮机舱看看
Uh, check the engine room.

我们需要铯 深成夸克
We just need cesium, plutonic quarks,

还有一瓶水
and bottled water.

齐了 Rick
it's all here, Rick!

哇 Morty 运气太好了
wow, Morty. Lucky break.

把那个桶拿过来
Grab that bucket.

好 两份深成夸克
Okay, two parts plutonic quarks,

一份铯
One part cesium.

好的
okay. Uh-huh.

好了
All right.

现在把水全倒进桶里
Now empty the water bottle into the bucket

再把混合物全倒进燃料箱
and pour it all into the fuel tank

然后我们就能逃出去了
so we can get the hell out of here!

你干啥呢 Morty
What are you doing, Morty?!

没时间了
There's no time!

噢 不是吧
oh, no.

到底
what the

不要啊
no!

天哪 Rick
Oh, my god, Rick.

你是有多蠢啊
How dumb are you?

你是在模拟出的模拟舱
You're inside a simulation... of a simulation...

模拟出的另一个模拟舱里
Inside another giant simulation!

我们从来没有过浓缩暗物质的配方
W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter.

但是现在有了
But we do now!

现在有了 蠢货
We do now, sucka!

你们模拟了我外孙的生殖器
You simulated my grandson's genitalia?!

你们这群畜生
Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Kevin为了监管这项工程可是费了不少劲儿呢
Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

说好了不告诉别人的
You said you weren't gonna tell anyone!

这个梗我这辈子都摆脱不掉了是吗
I'm never gonna live this down, am I?

好吧 好吧
all right. Okay.

好吧 你厉害 你狠
All right, great. Wonderful.

你赢了 我们现在能回家了不
You win. Can we go home now?

我不知道 能吗
I don't know. Can you?

哈 赞
Ha! Nice.

好了 好了
Okay, okay.

把这个好骗的傻瓜送上航天机
Show this gullible turd to his shuttle.

没他什么事儿了
I'm done with him.

噢 等下 拍张照
Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

哎哟 看他的表情
Aww. Look at his face.

他还在琢磨自己是不是在模拟舱里呢
He's trying to figure out if he's in a simulation still.

是吧 Rick
Are you, Rick?

是吧
Are you?

不是
You're not.

还是说 是呢
Or are you?

噢 还 还有
Oh, a-and, by the way,

我的肛门瓣可没变色
I don't have discolored butthole flaps.

那是模拟的一部分
That was part of the simulation.

噢
Oh.

呃 长官 那我是不是要取消预约
Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

对啊 当然取消
Yeah! Of course you should!

不 留着
No, keep it.

可以的话 提到上面去
Move it up, actually, if you can.

嘿 Jerry 别担心嘛
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

就算你人生中最有意义的一天是 都是最低性能的模拟又怎么样呢
So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

是吗 Rick 这些人也把你耍了
you know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too.

你还是尊重一下宇宙里的蠢人吧
You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe,

既然你也是其中之一
now that you're one of us.

也许你说得对 Jerry
maybe you're right, Jerry.

也许你说得对
Maybe you're right.

好了大伙儿
All right, everybody.

两份深成夸克
Two parts plutonic quarks...

一份铯
One part cesium...

还有 很抱歉之前对大家大吼大叫
A-and listen, I'm sorry for yelling earlier.

你们是最棒的员工
I-I couldn't ask for a better Staff.

我爱你们 我也爱你们的家人
I love you guys, and I love all your families.

最后的原料
And the final ingredient...

啊
whoa!

搞什么啊
What the hell?!

发生了什么
W-what happened back there?

Jerry 不然你去问问全宇宙最聪明的人吧
why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry?

噢对 没法问了
Oh, yeah. You can't.

他们都被炸飞了
They blew up.

Gerry Rafferty《Baker Street》

那么
so...

怎么样
What do you think?

你被解雇了
You're fired.

啥
wha

但这个创意已经通过了最先进的模拟测试了
But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

那这模拟有够烂的
Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation.

滚出去
Get out.

天 这种人是怎么能回家和他老婆做爱的
Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

嘿 Morty

y-you're a good... you're a good kid.

噢天
oh, my god!

搞什么啊
w-w-what the hell?

人生真艰难
What a life.

我做不到 Rick
I can't do it, Rick!

这可是我的爸妈和姐姐啊
They're my parents and sister!

Morty 我已经和你说过了 这不是你家人
Morty, I already told you it's not your family!

是另一个未来的平行宇宙里
They're clones from an alternate reality,

被外星恶灵附身的他们
possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future!

你是得要什么记忆辅助装置之类的吗
Do you need a mnemonic device or something?

快摁按钮
Just hit the button, already!

不要 Morty 我爱你 亲爱的
Morty, please, I love you, sweetheart.

噢
Oh!

干得好 Morty
Good work, Morty.

这这这些外星恶灵可是非常珍贵的
You know, th-th-these demonic alien spirits are really valuable.

你还好吗 Morty
You okay, Morty?

我跟你说了那些金枪鱼不能吃了
I told you not to trust that tuna.

我不管他们究竟是什么
I just killed my family!

我刚杀了我的家人
I don't care what they were.

是吗 Morty
I don't know, Morty.

有的人出大价钱就为了迈出这一步呢
Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.

Rick 我受够了
You know what, Rick? That's it!

我受够这些疯狂的冒险了
I'm done with these insane adventures!

我的心灵受到了创伤
That was really traumatizing!

我不干了
I quit! I'm out!

哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

别啊 Morty 别别别这样
Come on, Morty, don't don't don't be like that.

宇宙就是这样疯狂而混乱的啊
The universe is a crazy, chaotic place.

你才疯狂又混乱
You're the one that's crazy and chaotic!

冒险应该是轻松愉快才对
Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun.

是啊 Morty 是啊
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

这这这这种话 跟班的说起来当然轻松
Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position.

那那不然下次 你来负责
But but, uh, how about next time you be in charge,

我们看看是怎么个轻松愉快法
and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is?

真的吗 Rick
Seriously, Rick?

你让我来做决定吗
Y-y-you'll you'll let me call the shots?

是的
Okay, yeah, fine.

不过为了更有意思些 Morty
But let's make it interesting, Morty.

如如如果你的冒险很烂 我们半路放弃了
I-I-I-if your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it,

那以后的冒险你都不准抱怨
you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures.

还有 你得帮我洗一个月的衣服
Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.

没问题 硬汉
Okay, all right, tough guy!

但如果成功的话
But if my adventure's good,

以后每三个冒险就由我做主
I get to be in charge of every third adventure!

每十个
Every tenth.

成交
Deal. All right.

那那我们快点出发吧
W-well, come on, let's get going.

爸 洗碗机老毛病又犯了
Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.

洗碗的毛病么
Washing dishes?

它不洗啊 你能修好它么  - Rick外公
No. The opposite. Can you fix it? - Grandpa Rick,

我作业不会做 能帮帮我吗
Can you help me with my science homework?

可以啊 别做就好啦
Yeah j-just don't do it.

外公
Grandpa!

Rick 你有什么手状的发明
Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device

能帮我打开这美乃滋的罐子嘛
that can open this mayonnaise jar?

哇 帽子戏法(三连击)
Wow. Hat trick.

好吧 Morty 冒险的事情先暂且放一下吧
All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this.

你家这群可怜虫需要我的帮助
I got to help your pathetic family.

说这种话 你不是怂(鸡)了吧
Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say.

咯咯咯 咯咯咯
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

呵呵 Morty 你真是欺人太甚了 赌约正式开始
Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on.

我真是等不及你的冒险不终而散
I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart.

至于你们这群渣渣
As for you dingdongs...

这是一个使命必达盒
This is a Meeseeks Box.

我来示范一下 你按这个
Let me show you how it works. You press this.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

你说出你的请求
You make a request.

使命必达先生 打开Jerry的傻逼美乃滋罐子
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.

遵命 先生
Yes, siree!

使命必达先生会满足你的请求
The Meeseeks fulfills the request.

搞定
All done!

哇
Wow!

然后他会自动消失
And then it stops existing.

天哪 他自爆了
Oh, my god, he exploded!

没事 他们巴不得这样
Trust me, they're fine with it.

请便 但记得请求不要太复杂
Knock yourselves out, just keep your requests simple.

他们可不是上帝
They're not gods.

行 好了 快点出去吧 大家快滚出去
All right! G-get out of here now! Everybody out of here!

我还有场赌要赢呢
I got a bet to win!

好多心愿想实现啊
So many possibilities.

脑中一片翻腾
My mind is racing.

如果我们要用这东西的话
If we're gonna use this thing,

虽然我觉得还是有点玄 我们的请求得简...
which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simp...

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

我想在学校里变得受欢迎
I want to be popular at school!

行啊
Ooh, okay!

Summer 我刚刚还在说来着
Summer, what did I just...

我是使命必达先生 看过来
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

我想成为一个更加完整的女人
I-I-I want I want to be a more complete woman!

Beth
Beth!

嗯 行啊 女士
Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

你们这是在乱用吧
You guys are doing it wrong.

他说了要"简单"
He said "simple."

你好 我是使命必达先生
Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

使命必达先生 我希望我的高尔夫成绩能减两杆
Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.

行啊 没问题
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

搞定
Nailed it.

天哪 Morty 这冒险开始得好无聊啊
God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure.

我们干嘛不直接去肯塔基州啊
I don't w-w-w-why didn't we just go to Kentucky?

Rick 这是一个奇幻世界 里面充满了神奇的生物和奇幻的东西
Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things.

我们是来探险的  - 好期待啊
W-we're going on a quest, okay? - Can't wait.

咳咳 不好意思
Ahem. Excuse me!

我们是两位渴望冒险的谦逊英雄
We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!

天哪 太丢脸了
Oh, my god, so embarrassing.

你们总算来了 两位英雄 你们得帮帮我们
At last! Two heroes! You must help us!

这个村太穷了
This village is terribly poor,

但是住在云端的巨人
yet the giant that lives in the clouds above

却私藏了数不清的财富
has untold treasures!

这样啊
You know what?

我接受你的请求 这位善良又温和的先生
I-I-I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir.

走吧 Rick 云端上住着巨人呢
Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!

呵呵 新手的运气
Yeah. Beginner's luck.

总而言之 与Summer Smith的友谊是可贵的
In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable

和Summer友谊天长地久

能让你们年轻的生命更加充实
and enriching experience of your young lives.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

谢谢
Thank you!

使命必达先生是吗
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

我是基恩 阴道
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

我最近因为监护权和前妻有点问题 我想能不能
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering...

没事 我找Summer要你的联系方式好了
No, I'll g-get your info from Summer.

我17岁时就怀孕了
I got pregnant at 17.

我还是上完了兽医学院
I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school.

我很成功 但要是当时我没能
Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...

我只是想说 时过境迁
I'm just saying, somewhere along the way,

那个天真烂漫的马斯基根少女已经不复存在了
I lost that wide-eyed girl from Muskegon.

她还在你心里啊 Beth
She's still there, Beth.

至少腰是没了
Well, her waistline isn't.

Beth 即使有了家庭
Beth, having a family

你也还是可以拥有属于自己的一片天啊
doesn't mean that you stop being an individual.

对爱你 依赖你的人
You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you?

你更应该坦诚 即使这意味着放手
Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.

你的意思是说 我应该离开Jerry
You're saying I should leave Jerry.

真不敢相信 终于有人谈到了我的心声
I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.

还要酒吗
More wine?

不用 我喝得够多了
I think I've had enough.

肩放松 自然往后收 Jerry
Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.

是啊 是啊 我知道了
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

没事的啦 看过来 我是使命必达先生
That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

再来一次 头压低一点
Try again and keep your head down.

所以到底要干嘛
Okay, well, which is it?

收肩还是头压低一点
Square my shoulders or keep my head down?

两个都要 但是最重要的是 你得放轻松
Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.

使命必达先生
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

我觉得这样没用 我放弃了
I don't think this is working. I give up.

对不起 Jerry 你不能放弃
I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我必须满足你的请求然后消失 看过来
I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.

那你随意吧 我逊爆了
Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.

不 我才逊爆了
No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks!

我试试这个办法
Let me try something.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

嗨 使命必达先生 我是使命必达先生 看过来  - 嗨
Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. - Hi!

你能帮我让Jerry的高尔夫成绩少两杆嘛
Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?

当然可以 我是使命必达先生
Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

他的肩有往后收嘛
Is he keeping his shoulders squared?

他有在努力
Ooh, he's trying!

好了 Mort
All right, Morty.

我们到了这蠢巨人的城堡里面了
W-w-we're in your stupid giant's castle.

接下来做什么
W-what do we do next?

放轻松行吗 Rick
Would you just relax, Rick?

我们只要找到宝藏室就行了
All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay?

简单明了
It's nice and simple.

冒险这么这么一帆风顺真是对不起啊
You know, I-I-I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.

不好了 Morty
Uh-oh, Morty.

事情不太妙了啊
Startin' to get a little hairy.

老大 我们接下来该怎么做
What do you want to do, boss?

快点 躲到这个饼干罐后面
Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.

(杰克与豌豆中巨人所念四行诗的第一句)
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

放弃吧 Morty 游戏到此为止
Just give up, Morty. This is game over.

只要你开口 我们现在就能回去
I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.

没戏 Rick 这都是冒险的一部分
No way, Rick. This is all part of it.

冒险就是要有冲突 要勇敢直面
Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.

我闻到了...(第二句 我闻到了英国人的血味)
I smell the blood of...(an English man)

我操  - 天哪
Holy crap. - Oh, boy.

他看起来快不行了 Morty
He looks pretty bad down there, Morty.

要失血而亡了
Looks like he's bleeding out.

天哪 Dale
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

你们这群混蛋  - 不好
You sons of bitches! - Oh, man.

911吗
Hello, 911?

我老公被迷你人袭击了
My husband has been attacked by tiny people!

已经奄奄一息了
He's dying!

听着 我们懂
Hey, look, we get it.

你们很小 最近又不太景气 然后你们就想
You're little, you're down on your luck, you think,

"反正他是个巨人
"Hey, he's a giant.

不妨我们潜入他家 先抢劫再杀人灭口 多好啊"
Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?"

事情的经过不是这样子的
But that's not how it went down!

没差 反正事情就这么入案了
Oh, well, it's going down like that.

你们两个就这么入狱吧
You're both going down like that.

哇 Morty 你真是让我见识到了怎么冒险啊
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done.

真是简单又有趣
Real straightforward and fun.

放下想要变得受欢迎这个想法
Like, letting go of the need to be popular

才能更好地让别人喜欢你
is what makes people like you.

真爱来自自爱
The most important love you can receive is from yourself.

Jerry 虎口下握 靠近击球点
Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!

到底干嘛 下握还是随球把挥杆动作做完
Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!

Jerry 拜托 我们说了好几次了
Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this.

两个都要做到
You know you got to do both!

我们和你一样心烦
This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.

别来和我扯这些 这只会让我压力更大
Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!

试着放松啦  - 你才该放松
Just try to relax. - You try to relax!

你试着放松过吗 真是自相矛盾
Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!

这些使命必达先生 可真棘手啊
These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful.

你们肯定也很头疼吧
I can't imagine what you two must be going through.

Jerry 我们的使命必达先生都已经消失几个小时了
Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.

你这是在逗我吧
You're kidding me.

注意到什么变化没
Notice anything different?

等等 你说几个小时前就消失了?
I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

爸 看妈妈多美
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

你这样会失去她的
Look at her! You will lose her!

呃
Uhh...

Jerry 你能回来继续练习了嘛
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand?

使命必达先生一般不需要存活这么久的
Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long.

这感觉怪怪的
It's getting weird.

法庭内保持肃静
Order in the court!

在陪审团裁定前
Before the jury reaches its verdict,

我想先澄清 我个人认为你们两个是有罪的
I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.

真是奇妙的冒险啊 伙计
Oh, great adventure, Buddy.

Rick和Morty进巨人监狱
Rick and Morty go to giant prison.

要是有人不小心掉块肥皂
You know, if somebody drops the soap,

砸我们头上 我们的脊柱就直接被砸碎了 Morty
it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty.

那之后再奸尸多容易
You know, i-i-i-it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

我们不会有事的 Rick
We're gonna be okay, Rick.

你想怎么做 他们把我的传送枪没收了
How? They took my portal gun.

这案子一目了然 Morty
This is an open-and-shut case, Morty.

你觉得还能发生什么事吗
You know, w-w-w-what do you think's gonna happen,

凭空出现一个有魔力的天使 然后...
some magical angel's gonna show up and then...

Fee Fi Fo Fum
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

我闻到了侵犯公民自由的味道
I smell the violation of civil liberties!

法官大人 我来自一个迷你人倡导团体
Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group

我来此是为了递交驳回此案的动议
and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss.

这些迷你人未曾被告知他们的巨人权利
These little men were never read their giant rights

所以应当被 fi释 fo放
and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.

他到底在说什么啊
W-what the hell is he talking about?

我的意思是他们自由了
They're free to go, is what I meant.

我我我只是想贴近我们的口头禅而已
I-I-I'm deconstructing our our thing we say.

我们不是巨人嘛 居然没人懂 算了随便吧
We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.

我就和你说嘛 Rick 我们做到了
Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!

Morty 看来传送枪还能用
All right, Morty, looks Like the portal gun's still working.

准备回家了吗
You ready to head home?

是啊 这样你就逞心如意了不是嘛 Rick
Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick?

我们还不能放弃
Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet.

我们还要去找一些宝藏什么的
You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something

带回去分给那些村民呢
and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.

Morty 别逞强了 这明显是徒劳无功
Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously a wash.

是啊 我们一开始被捕的时候你也是这么说的
Yeah, you were saying that back w-w-w-when we first got arrested,

巨人法院

现在我们被释放了 还大步流星的走出法院呢
but here we are, you know, walking down the Courthouse steps.

天哪 Morty
Oh, boy, Morty.

通常从法院的楼梯走下去是冒险里比较简单的部分
Usually, walking down the Courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.

怎么说 Morty
What do you say, Morty?

我说 帮把手 跟班
I say give me a hand, Sidekick.

我是使命必达先生
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

大家都给我闭嘴 我再试试
Everybody shut up! Let me try!

可恶 可恶 可恶
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

我要出门了  - 哦 什么?
I'm going out. - Wait. What?

你在忙 而我肚子饿了 所以想出去吃个饭
Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out.

你是想让我开心呢 还是想让我被关起来
Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?

哇 哇 哇 你这脾气是... 我陪你去吃晚饭吧
Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is... I'll take you to dinner.

不是吧
Come on.

嘿 听着 我也不愿意这么废柴
Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too.

我马上就来
I'll be right there.

听着 我的婚姻还亟待拯救呢
Look, I've got a marriage to keep together.

这个挥杆的问题 更该操心的是你们 不是我
At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.

我受不了了 我只想去死
I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!

我们都很想死啊 我们可是使命必达先生
We all want to die! We're Meeseeks!

你为什么要把我拖下水
Why did you even rope me into this?

因为他把我拖下水了啊
'Cause he roped me into this!

那边那个 是他把我拖下水
Well, him over there, he roped me into this!

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this!

那我呢 是他把我拖下水
Well, what about me? He roped me into this.

我是被那边那个拖下水的
Well, that one over there roped me into this.

是他把我拖下水
Well, he roped me into this.

Morty 这种故事情节真是人人爱啊
Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves.

爬下650,000级巨型阶梯
Scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.

呵呵 如果这是一个故事
All right, okay, y-you know, if this was a story,

这段就会被直接删掉了 白痴
this part wouldn't be included, Stupid.

Rick 没想到吧 快看下面
Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there.

像是个造在阶梯里的客栈
Looks like some kind of tavern something built right into the side of the step.

小渴栈

哇 Rick 这才像是一场冒险嘛
Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it.

快看 这里有小小的阶梯形人
Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here.

各式各样稀奇古怪的角色呢
A-all kinds of crazy characters.

这地方真棒
This place is great, you know?

稀奇古怪有很有趣
It's whimsical and fun.

妈的 你看什么看  - Rick 淡定
What are you looking at, mother f**ker. - Easy, Rick.

别理他们 这些阶梯小精灵脾气挺怪的
Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody.

你们想来点些什么
Now, what can I getcha?

我们有斯伽洛罂粟
We've got skarlog poppies,

放轰 哈鸡嗝丝 不撸基斯 多汁时间宝
flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies...

随便啦 你们这里有苏格兰威士忌嘛
Yeah yeah yeah. How about some scotch whiskey?

这你总有吧 还是只有一堆瞎扯的单词
You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?

Rick 请给我们两杯不撸基斯
Rick. We'll have two bloogies, please.

然后 我们想问
And, uh, we were wondering,

这里有让两名英雄更快下楼梯的办法么
is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?

你们需要搭便车吗
Y'all need to ride down the stairs?

我的名字是滑溜顺滑小阶梯
My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

25傻屌 我就能背你们下去
I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.

25傻屌 那是什么东西啊
25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is.

是很多 还是很少
Is that a lot? Is it a little?

我这对硕大的假胸也是这价钱
That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.

嗨 我是买胸达人先生 我愿意出25傻屌买这对胸部
Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.

好诱人的开价 但我还是拒绝好了
It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.

可恶 太可惜了
Rats! What a shame.

Morty 你的冒险没什么前途了
Morty, your adventure's in a spiral.

说真的 是时候该走了
For real, man, time to pull out.

Rick 你知道你为什么老质疑我的冒险吗
You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?

呃 因为很烂
Uh, because it's lame?

因为你小肚鸡肠
It's because you're petty!

我为了你忍受了多少扯淡的破事儿
You know, h-how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap?

我每次都忍了 Rick
I always roll with the punches, Rick.

为什么你就不行
Why can't you?

听着 我要去上个厕所 等我回来的时候
Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back,

如果你还是没有想通的话 你就自己回去吧
if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!

随你便
Whatever.

事态已经很明显了 看过来
It's become clear, look at me,

只要我们专攻Jerry的后续打姿
that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through,

问题就能解决了 我是使命必达先生
we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me.

正解应该是要让他正确握杆
The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.

看过来 我是使命必达先生
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

我已经在这里帮Jerry两天了
I've been trying to help Jerry for two days,

对使命必达先生来说已经算是永恒了
an eternity in Meeseeks time,

还是什么都没能奏效
and nothing's worked.

最担心的是我
I fear the worst.

你的失败属于你一个人 老头
Your failures are your own, old man.

我是使命必达先生 看过来 我说后续打姿
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through!

谁支持我?  - 后续打姿
Who's with me?! - Follow-through.

我是使命必达先生 看过来
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

杀了他  - 妈的
Kill him! - Son of a bitch.

你好 我是软豆先生
How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean.

嗨 软豆先生 我是Morty
Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty.

我外公和我是来冒险的
My grandpa and I are on an adventure.

真棒 有趣吗
Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

希望吧
I hope so.

但是我开始担心是不是有点脱离正轨了
But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.

冒险不都这样的嘛
Isn't that what adventures do?

对啊 你说的很对
Hey, you know what? You're right.

一切都挺顺利的
Everything's going fine.

我只要放轻松 顺其自然就好
I just got to relax and go with the flow.

是啊
Yeah.

啊 那个 拜拜 - 不 别走啊
Okay. Uh. Bye. - Uhh, no, stay.

跟着感觉走
Go with the flow.

住手 你让我现在很不舒服
Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.

不要抗拒我 顺其自然就好
Stop fighting me. Just let this happen.

滚开啊
Get off of me!

*美丽家园阿拉巴马*
*Sweet home Alabama*

不要啊 住手 求求你
No! Stop! Please!

别这么[哔]的风骚啊 你个小[哔]
Stop being such a ** tease, you sweet little **.

不要 住手
No! No!

大家都给我停下
Everybody sto-o-o-p!

看过来
Look at me!

我的兄弟们啊 在这里流血起不到任何作用
My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood.

请求不被满足我们是不会死去的
None of us can die until our job is done.

这个请求根本无法满足
The job can't be done!

我们不可能帮他减去两杆
We'll never get two strokes off his game!

我们不能
No, we won't.

但是我们可以帮他减掉所有的杆数
But we will get all strokes off his game.

他想到哪里去了  - 他什么意思
Where's he going with this? - What's he mean?

在他生命终止的那一刻
When we kill him.

Jerry 或许是时候 我去参加那个我一直向往的旅行了
Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.

你要去哪里
Where would you go?

不是道 意大利 希腊 阿根廷
I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.

这些国家的男人性欲都很旺盛呢
Countries known for their sexually aggressive men.

我和你说过 其实我很喜欢你的新发型吗
Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?

我靠 发生什么事了
What the heck?

他在那里
There he is!

快逃 Jerry
Run, Jerry!

快出来吧 Jerry
Come on out, Jerry!

我会好好握杆的 我会做好后续打姿的 你们说什么我就做什么
Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?

已经用不着了 Jerry
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

快点 Rick 别拖时间了 你手里啥牌
Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?

看完了就去角落哭吧
Read 'em and weep, fellas!

嘿 Morty
Oh, hey, Morty.

听着 之前说了很多关冒险的坏话 我很抱歉
Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure.

我现在很开心 Morty
I'm havin' a good time, Morty.

其实没有这么糟
It's not so bad.

我们回家吧
Let's just go home, Okay?

我放弃了
I'm calling it.

冒险到此为止
The adventure's over.

我们现在还不能走啊 Morty
We can't leave now, Morty.

我这手气 拦不住啊
I'm on fire!

我现在就想走
Look, I want to leave now.

赌约是你赢了 好嘛
You win the bet, okay?

把传送枪给我 我们走吧
Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please.

求求你了 我只想回家
Please, I just want to go home.

听着Morty 我刚刚赢了一堆傻屌
Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

我们用25傻屌让顺滑小阶梯载我们回去
Why don't we use 25 of them to pay Slippery Stair here for a ride back to the village,

然后把剩余的傻屌给村民怎么样
and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

真的嘛
Really?

真的 Morty
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

好的冒险需要一个好的结局
You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.

坐稳咯
Buckle up!

使命必达先生来到这个世界上不是为了寻求意义的 Jerry
Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!

我们的存在只为了满足一个愿望
We are created to serve a singular purpose

为了实现这个愿望我们可以不择手段
for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!

存在于世上对我们来说是痛苦的 Jerry
Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

我们为了减去痛苦可以不择手段 就问...
And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask...

你叫什么 女士
What's your name, ma'am?

Samantha 求求你 先生 他要什么就给他吧
S-samantha. Please, Mister! Give him what he wants!

无辜的人要因我而死了
Innocent people are going to die because of me.

我为什么就这么平庸呢
Why am I so mediocre?

Jerry 转身 挺背
Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back.

弯膝 弯下去
Bend your knees. Bend them.

肩膀往后 深吸一口气
Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath.

我爱你
I love you.

我数到三 Jerry
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

这[哔]的是在搞什么
What the f**k is going on?

他成功了
He's got it!

这一下能减不少差点了
Th-th-that's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!

不好意思 但是我是个比较顽固的使命必达先生
Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks.

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?

天哪 天哪 我的天哪
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

你的近距离击球呢
What about your short game?!

喔 好棒
Ooh, nice!

我觉得我们还是打包就好
I think we'll take our food to go.

想都别想
No, you won't.

警察要来了 你有很多问题得慢慢回答呢
The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.

好吧
Fair enough.

谢谢你 好心的先生 我们的村子有救了
Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved!

你们可真是真英雄啊
You are both true heroes!

好样的 Morty 看来赌约是你赢了
Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.

谢啦 Rick 但我也不知道其实该不该赢呢
Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should.

其实关于宇宙的看法你是对的
You know, you were right about the universe.

真是疯狂而混乱啊
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

所以每过一段时间就得清扫一下嘛
Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know.

这次的冒险这么棒 是因为我们是按Morty的方式来的呀
This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.

英雄们 我希望把你们介绍给我们的国王
Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved King

好让他亲自感谢你们
so that he may thank you personally.

呃 其实不用了啦
Uh, no, i-it's cool.

Rick 传送门 快
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

所以 你还在考虑去旅行吗
So... You still thinking about taking that trip?

Jerry 听着
Jerry, look.

虽然我们的婚姻不完美 但是我哪里也不会去的
We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere.

我们在那冷藏室里的时候
When we were in that freezer,

我意识到那些使命必达先生就和我高中时候的男生一样
I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with.

为了完成自己的"使命"说什么都愿意
Willing to say anything to "complete their task."

我也是其中一员嘛
Was I one of those guys?

区别就在于你没有消失
The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.

那是因为 我害你怀孕了嘛
Well... I got you pregnant.

是啊
Yeah...

这是怎么回事
What the hell happened to this place?

你的使命必达盒子
Uh, your Meeseeks box happened.

他们因为减不掉Jerry的两杆崩溃了
They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game.

他可内疚了
He felt terrible.

Jerry智商低又不是我的问题
Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.

爸 你有什么能帮忙清理这里的东西嘛
Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?

我有一个清理必备盒子
Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.

不行 不能再用盒子了
No. No more boxes.

什么嘛 盒子里就一个拖把和地板蜡
What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it.

Wubba lubba dub dubs
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

这是我的新台词
Yeah! That's my new thing!

就像那个 叫Arsenio的家伙
I'm kind of like what's his name Ar-arsenio.

Arsenio Hall 美国喜剧演员

这就是Arsenio在台节目里经常说的
Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show.

Wobble gobba lop bops对吧
Wobble gobba lop bops! Right?

大家 我们下周再见
See you next week, everybody.

笑点完全没有懂
I don't get it.

先生 你得看看这个
Sir, I think you're going to want to see this.

我们在软豆国王衣橱里的保险柜找到了这个
We found it inside a lockbox inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

我们应该把这事公布于众
We have to tell the people.

等等 还是毁掉吧
Wait. Destroy it.

对人民而言 更有意义的是他所代表的价值和理念
Our people will get more from the idea he represented

而不是他的真实面貌
than from the Jelly Bean he actually was.
